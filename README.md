# BR test project
This is the test project of Murat Remzi Tezyapar for the application to the role of iOS Developer at BR.

## Description
The purpose of the project is to fetch photo list (with a query text) from the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/), show them in a collection view and show detail screen when selected.


**Architecture**

MVVM-C pattern is used for the structure with the help of Combine Framework.

Basically, MainCoordinator is the composition root of the project. It composes all the components of the requirements which PhotoSearchViewController requires. It also performs navigation to detail screen by creating and delegating this responsibilty to PhotoDetailCoordinator.

RemoteClient is responsible of making HTTP requests. By the help of FlickrEndpoint, URL is generated by composing URLQueryParameters. PhotoSearch extension is used to compose the URL with additional method specific parameters.

FlickrSearchPhotoResponse is the container for FlickrPhoto list which is somewhat flattened version of the original response.
PhotoListItem is the model that is used within UI components which is a much lighter version of the original FlickrPhoto model.


**Tests**

Endpoint, MainCoordinator, PhotoDetailCoordinator and PhotoSearchViewModel are tested.


**Error Handling**
Error and empty state handling is not present on the app. 


**Version info**
- Xcode: 14.2 (14C18)
- Minimum deployment target: 16.2
